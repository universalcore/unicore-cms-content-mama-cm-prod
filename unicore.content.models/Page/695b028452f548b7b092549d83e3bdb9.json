  "content": "I've realised something about myself \u2013 I'm not very easy to live with when I'm pregnant. When I was pregnant with my first child, I remember being surprised at how angry I would get with my husband. We had terrible fights! But now I\u2019m quite sure it was just the pregnancy hormones. Thankfully once my daughter was born things became normal. But it didn't do my marriage much good.\r\n\r\nNow, ten years later, I\u2019m pregnant with twins. And those crazy pregnancy hormones are playing with my moods again! There have been a few days when I really and truly just lost my temper. But this time it\u2019s not just my husband who has had to deal with my moods.  \r\n\r\nRecently, I ran into a road crying in anger at something so small I can\u2019t even remember what it was. Last week, I was angry and remained in a room alone when we visited my husband\u2019s family for dinner. When I came out, I found my husband had taken my advice and gone home without me! \r\n\r\nI also shouted at friends who were staying in our home with us when I came home from my job to find the dishes not washed!  Then there was the day I closed our front door with anger in the face of somebody who was trying to sell me vegetables. \r\n\r\nI even started crying when somebody said something kind to me and helped me into the bus! \r\n\r\nThank goodness the ups and downs are almost over... I just hope that I will be forgiven for my mood swings by the time baby comes.\r\n\r\n**MAMA HELP: its common express different attitudes/emotions during pregnancy. This is partly because of the change you face in your life. It is also partly because of the rise in hormone levels in your body. This can affect your mood, making you feel tearful or easily angry.**\r\n",
